## Automated Application Deployment to VM using GitHub Actions (with Rollback Support)

### Concept Overview

This project automates the deployment of a web application to a virtual machine (VM) using **GitHub Actions**. The solution:
- Minimizes manual intervention and deployment errors.
- Implements a rollback mechanism to revert to the last stable state in case of failure.
- Ensures high availability and faster recovery, especially for production environments.

### Objective
To implement a robust and reliable CI/CD pipeline using:
- GitHub Actions for automation,
- Rsync for efficient file transfers,
- Systemd-managed services like Gunicorn and Celery,
- Rollback support in case of deployment issues,
- Conditional service restarts based on code changes.

### Architecture Overview
```text
Developer Pushes Code → GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
                         ↓
                  Self-Hosted Runner on VM (EC2)
                         ↓
                Bash Scripts: deploy.sh / rollback_latest.sh
                         ↓
        Gunicorn, Nginx, Celery, and Celery Beat Restarted as Needed
                         ↓
            Slack Notifications for Success or Rollback
```

### Deployment Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to main or master.
2. GitHub Actions picks up the push via self-hosted runner.
3. deploy.sh is triggered by workflow and performs:
     - Create timestamped directory in /home/ubuntu/releases/<timestamp>
     - Copy source code from /home/ubuntu/git-source (not directly from .git)
     - Set up or reuse shared Python virtual environment
     - Install dependencies if requirements.txt changed
     - Apply Django database migrations
     - Copy .env file and link latest release with: `ln -sfn /home/ubuntu/releases/<timestamp> /home/ubuntu/current`
     - Restart services (Gunicorn, Celery, etc.)
4. If deployment fails:
     - rollback_latest.sh is triggered
     - Restores symlink to the previous release and Restarts services to revert to stable state
5. Slack Notifications:
     - ✅ Success → "Deployment Successful"
     - ❌ Failure → "Deployment Failed - Rollback Triggered"

Script Name	|Description	| Path
deploy.sh	  |Handles deployment with zero downtime	|/home/ubuntu/deploy.sh
rollback_latest.sh	|Handles rollback to last stable release	|/home/ubuntu/rollback_latest.sh

### Permissions:
``` bash
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/deploy.sh
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/rollback_latest.sh
```

### Deployment Strategy 

#### 1. Conditional Dependency Installation 
Only install Python dependencies if requirements.txt has changed, saving time and resources. Avoids unnecessary reinstallation, speeds up deploys, and ensures dependencies are always up-to-date when needed.
***Details:***
- Computes a SHA256 hash of requirements.txt.
- Compares it to the last deployed hash (stored in $REQ_HASH_FILE).
```bash
# Only installs if requirements.txt changed
REQ_HASH=$(sha256sum requirements.txt | awk '{print $1}')
if [ ! -f "$REQ_HASH_FILE" ] || [ "$(cat $REQ_HASH_FILE)" != "$REQ_HASH" ]; then
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
fi
```
- If changed or first deploy: 
    - Upgrades pip for latest features and security.
    - Installs dependencies with --no-cache-dir to avoid stale packages.
    - Stores the new hash for future comparison.

#### 2. Timestamp-based releases
We use timestamp-based releases combined with symbolic links to manage and switch deployments cleanly.  
This strategy allows us to:
- Instantly revert to any previous release in seconds
- Keep multiple releases available simultaneously
- Switch to a new release without downtime
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
RELEASE_DIR="$RELEASES_DIR/$TIMESTAMP"
ln -sfn "$RELEASE_DIR" /home/ubuntu/Hiringdog-backend
```
- **Original Git Repository**:  
  `/home/ubuntu/git-source`  
  Contains the cloned GitHub repo (with `.git/`).
- **Timestamped Release Directories**:  
  `/home/ubuntu/releases/<timestamp>`  
  Each deployment creates a new folder named by timestamp (e.g., `20250611111202`), created via `rsync` from the Git repo.
- **Active Symlink Directory**:  
  `/home/ubuntu/Hiringdog-backend`  
  This is a symbolic link that always points to the **currently active release** of the application.
  ```bash
  ln -sfn "$RELEASE_DIR" /home/ubuntu/Hiringdog-backend
  ```
This ensures minimal disruption and safer, atomic deployments.

#### 3. Zero Downtime Reload (Gunicorn)
Performs a blue/green style, zero-downtime reload of the Gunicorn application server, ensuring no dropped requests during deploys.
Sends signals in sequence:
- USR2: Starts a new master process with new workers (loads new code).
- WINCH: Gracefully shuts down old workers.
- TERM: Terminates the old master process
``` 
  kill -USR2 "$GUNICORN_PID"      # start new master
  kill -WINCH "$GUNICORN_PID"     # gracefully stop old workers
  kill -TERM "$GUNICORN_PID"      # stop old master
```
**Zero Downtime:**
- **No Request Loss**: All requests are handled during reload
- **Seamless Transition**: Users don't experience any interruption


#### 4. Selective Celery Restart
 Restart only if celery.py/, tasks.py/, or related files have changed:
```bash
# Check if Celery-related files changed
if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -E 'tasks\.py|celery(\.py|/)|requirements\.txt'; then
    sudo systemctl restart celery
    sudo systemctl restart celery-beat
else
    log "No changes affecting Celery. Skipping restart."
fi
```
- **Faster Deployments**: Saves 10-15 seconds when Celery restart isn't needed
- **Reduced Disruption**: Avoids unnecessary task queue interruptions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents unnecessary CPU and memory usage

#### 5. Rollback Strategy
Script: ` rollback_latest.sh `
Rollback Logic:
   - Identify the last successful release (based on timestamp)
   - Point current symlink to that release
   - Restart services to revert to previous state.

## Self-Hosted Runner Setup in a VM
### 1. Create a Dedicated User for GitHub Runner
```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" github-runner
```
This user is isolated and used only for GitHub Actions. It has no root access by default.

### 2. Register the Runner in GitHub
- Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → Runners
- Click "New self-hosted runner"
- Choose Linux x64, follow setup instructions.
```
# Install runner
cd /home/github-runner
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.311.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.311.0.tar.gz

# Configure runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/your-org/your-repo --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 3. Install the Runner as a Service
```bash
cd /home/github-runner/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

### User Permissions
User - `ubuntu`- Runs the application services
User- `github-runner`- Executes GitHub Actions workflows

Use sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/github-runner to give NOPASSWD for only required commands.
Example: 
```
rollback_latest.shgithub-runner ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart gunicorn, /bin/systemctl restar>
# Allow managing GitHub runner services
github-runner ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/github-runner/actions-runner/svc.sh, \
                                /bin/systemctl start actions.runner*, \
                                /bin/systemctl stop actions.runner*, \
                                /bin/systemctl status actions.runner*
github-runner ALL=(ubuntu) NOPASSWD: /home/ubuntu/rollback_latest.sh
github-runner ALL=(ubuntu) NOPASSWD: /home/ubuntu/deploy.sh
```

```

### manual trigger
To automate the restart process for application services in the environment using a manual trigger (dispatch event).
This ensures:
- Secure service management through GitHub Actions.
- Centralized control for service operations.
- Reduced human error while restarting services.

***Manual Trigger Configuration*** Create the workflow file in your repository at: ```.github/workflows/manual-restart.yml ```

```

### How to Trigger Manually
- Navigate to your repository in GitHub.
- Click the Actions tab. >> Select the workflow titled “Manual Service Restart”.
- Click Run workflow (top-right corner).
- Provide:
Service to restart → Choose the service (e.g., gunicorn, celery, redis, etc.)
Reason → Optional comment or description.
